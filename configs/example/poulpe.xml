    <!--This is a cache configuration file, it's required because JCommune and Poulpe are using shared distributed cache
      to communicate with updates. Thus, uncomment it if you need both Poulpe and JCommune running together at the same
      time. It should be similar to this config:
      https://github.com/jtalks-org/poulpe/blob/master/poulpe-model/src/main/resources/org/jtalks/poulpe/model/entity/ehcache.xml
